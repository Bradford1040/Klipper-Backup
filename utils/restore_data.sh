#  Just some todo thoughts
#  Should the script act independent of .env and always prompt for the token and repo you want to restore from,
# leaning toward yes as it allows one to run restore without having to first run install.sh

# Note:
  # use this when creating the restore script to add .theme changes back:
  # git apply $HOME/printer_data/config/klipper-backup-restore/theme_changes.patch
